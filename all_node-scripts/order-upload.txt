find schema at autosq-3/backend/partscentral-db/prisma/schema.prisma there.

What else do you need about order sheet so you can perfect script that handles ,stores only clean fields.??

im giving you order data in .txt fromat (is is copied from .xlsx file so not structerd/indented properly but you can read it here file location is : autosq-3/backend/partscentral-db/order-data-in-txt-format.txt)

also the location for file.json (see what mistekes the data has ) is autosq-3/backend/partscentral-db/file1.json .
so update node script .
